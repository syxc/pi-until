# pi-until

A Pi extension for non-blocking shell-condition watches and recurring follow-ups owned by one live Pi session.

For shell watches, **exit code 0 means true**. Pi checks immediately, then polls in the background. When the condition succeeds, the extension can wake the agent with a receipt or only show a notification.

For recurring follow-ups, Pi wakes the same agent every fixed interval with an immutable Markdown task packet. The agent must explicitly complete or cancel the recurrence.

## Why

Long-running work should not pin a tool call, burn model turns, or depend on someone remembering to check a terminal later.

`pi-until` turns this:

```sh
while ! ssh host 'test -f /tmp/done'; do sleep 30; done
```

into a session-owned watch that leaves Pi free for other work.

## Choose the primitive

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Resume when a cheap fact becomes true | `action: "start"` |
| Ask the same agent to do work on a fixed cadence | `action: "repeat"` |
| Survive Pi exit, session replacement, or reboot | Use a durable workload scheduler instead |

A shell condition is a predicate, not a job. If the command changes the system, it does not belong in `pi-until`.

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/syxc/pi-until@main
```

Then restart Pi or run `/reload`.

For local development:

```bash
pi install /path/to/pi-until
```

### Why this fork

Upstream pins a build toolchain through `devEngines` (`npm@11.16.0`, `node >=24.18.0`, `onFail: "error"`). npm 11 treats that as a **hard error**: on any environment running another version (e.g. npm 11.18.0 / node 24.14.0), `npm install` fails with `EBADDEVENGINES` and the whole install is aborted. There is no official npm config to disable that check.

This fork removes the whole `devEngines` field, so the extension installs with any npm/node version. Reinstall as usual (`pi install git:github.com/syxc/pi-until@main`) to pick up this fix.

## Agent tool

The extension registers `until` with six actions:

- `start` — begin a background shell-condition watch.
- `repeat` — begin a recurring agent follow-up.
- `list` — list watches in this Pi session.
- `status` — inspect one watch by ID.
- `complete` — mark a recurring watch complete.
- `cancel` — stop a watch without marking it complete.

A `start` call accepts:

- `condition` — side-effect-free shell command; exit 0 means true.
- `label` — short safe name.
- `cwd` — working directory; defaults to Pi's current directory.
- `intervalSeconds` — polling interval; defaults to 30.
- `checkTimeoutSeconds` — limit for one check; defaults to 30.
- `timeoutSeconds` — optional overall deadline.
- `wake` — `agent` or `notify`; defaults to `agent`.

Example intent:

```text
Watch until the remote verification receipt exists, then continue the migration review.
```

Equivalent condition:

```sh
ssh host 'test -f ~/migration/verify.done'
```

A `repeat` call accepts:

- `instruction` — the task given to the agent on every wake.
- `quickRef` — a short human reference for the recurring task.
- `contextRefs` — optional `{ label, target }` pointers. The extension passes them through without resolving them.
- `intervalSeconds` — the fixed cadence.
- `timeoutSeconds` — required absolute lifetime of the recurrence.
- `immediate` — `true` to wake after the current agent turn; otherwise the first wake follows one interval.
- `condition` — optional side-effect-free shell gate. Exit 0 permits that tick to wake the agent. It never completes the recurrence.
- `label` — optional safe display and telemetry label. It defaults to `recurring follow-up`, never to task text.
- `cwd` and `checkTimeoutSeconds` — settings for the optional gate.

```ts
until({
  action: "repeat",
  intervalSeconds: 21_600,
  timeoutSeconds: 86_400,
  instruction: "Review the deployment and fix remaining failures.",
  quickRef: "Release 42 verification",
  contextRefs: [{ label: "Runbook", target: "docs/release.md" }],
  condition: "test -f .deploy-finished",
  immediate: false,
});
```

The extension snapshots `instruction`, `quickRef`, `contextRefs`, and the origin session entry at start. Change the intent by completing or cancelling the old recurrence and starting another one.

Cadence stays anchored to the original schedule. One session-wide arbiter sends only one `pi-until` follow-up into Pi at a time. It waits for Pi to start that exact message and for the resulting agent turn to settle before it sends another. Missed ticks increase `missedTicks` instead of stacking agent turns. If acknowledgement takes more than five seconds, the arbiter pauses and warns instead of guessing that Pi discarded an accepted message. A late `message_start` resumes the lifecycle safely. A synchronous dispatch rejection fails the recurring watch.

The arbiter never sends a follow-up while Pi compacts the session outside an agent run, such as a manual `/compact`. Pi starts an extension-triggered turn even while it compacts, and that turn races the summarizer on the uncompacted context. Checks keep running during compaction; a wake that comes due waits. When compaction ends or fails, the arbiter waits five more seconds so a prompt queued behind compaction starts first, then delivers. Compaction inside an agent run needs no hold because the run already owns the session.

## Agent contract

- Treat `contextRefs` as opaque pointers. Read a target only when the instruction requires it.
- Call `complete` only when the recurring goal is achieved. A finished turn is not a finished recurrence.
- Call `cancel` when the recurrence should stop without success.
- An expired or failed receipt is terminal. Do not continue its instruction unless the user asks.

## Session display

Active watches appear in a compact card above the editor. Shell watches show check attempts. Recurring watches show deliveries, missed ticks, and whether a follow-up is pending or running. The card disappears when the session has no active watches.

```text
╭─ UNTIL · deploy verification ─────────────────────────╮
│ ◷ next 12s · 2m14s elapsed · 5 checks                 │
╰─ 8f2c1a7d · wakes agent · /until-list ────────────────╯
```

The footer is not used. `/until-list` opens a scrollable session panel with active and finished watches.

Other extensions can follow active watches on `pi.events`. Whenever the visible list changes (a watch starts, ticks, finishes, or is cancelled), the full list is emitted on `pi-until:watches`, including an empty list when the last watch finishes. Refreshes that change nothing do not emit.

```ts
pi.events.on("pi-until:watches", (watches) => {
  // [{ id, label, kind, status, wake, startedAt, nextDueAt, attempts, ... }]
});
```

## Sharing the follow-up queue

Another extension can hand an agent wake to the same session arbiter, so only one follow-up from either extension is submitted or running at a time. Emit a version 1 request on `pi-until:follow-up`:

```ts
let accepted = false;
pi.events.emit("pi-until:follow-up", {
  version: 1,
  source: "bellwether",       // non-empty; namespaces the dedupe key
  id: "batch-7",              // non-empty and unique per request from this source
  customType: "bellwether-wakes",
  content: "2 Bellwether waits settled. ...",
  details: { wakes: [...] },   // delivered as details.receipt
  accept: () => { accepted = true; },
});
if (!accepted) pi.sendMessage(/* deliver it yourself */);
```

`accept()` runs synchronously when pi-until queued the request. The caller must then not deliver it again. pi-until does not accept before `session_start`, during or after `session_shutdown`, or when the request is malformed; the caller keeps ownership in those cases. Pi receives the message with `details: { followUpId, receipt: details }` and `triggerTurn: true`, and the arbiter waits for that turn to settle before the next follow-up. An acknowledgement timeout pauses the queue exactly as it does for pi-until's own follow-ups.

## Commands

```text
/until <side-effect-free shell condition>
/until-list
/until-complete <id>
/until-cancel <id>
/until-stats
/until-resume
```

`/until` uses the defaults and wakes the agent when the condition succeeds. `/until-stats` summarizes the local telemetry file.

## Lifecycle

A watch belongs to one live Pi session/process.

- It survives normal agent turns.
- It does not block Pi.
- It survives `/reload`. Pi keeps the process and session alive across a reload and only replaces the extension instance. On `session_shutdown { reason: "reload" }` the extension terminates the in-flight check and writes a versioned watch value to a `pi-until-suspended` session entry. The new instance restores it only on `session_start { reason: "reload" }`. Definitions, task snapshots, counts, the next due time, and the absolute expiry carry over.
- It survives a graceful quit and relaunch of the same session. On `session_shutdown { reason: "quit" }` (Ctrl+D, `/quit`, SIGTERM, SIGHUP) the extension writes the same entry and records `reason: "quit"` and the owning session id. When a long-lived Pi process opens that session file again (`pi -c`, `pi --session <file>`, or `/resume` to it), `session_start` with reason `startup` or `resume` restores the watches with no command. Watches whose absolute expiry passed while Pi was closed, watches that later wrote a finished receipt, duplicate ids, and ids already active are skipped. A recurring watch whose tick came due while Pi was closed fires once with `missedTicks` counted and stays on its original cadence. The extension then appends a `pi-until-resumed` entry, so no later start can replay the same quit entry.
- It stops on `/new`, fork, or switching away from the session. Session replacement writes no entry, and a new or forked session inherits nothing, including a fork that copied the parent's quit entry. Graceful shutdown waits for process-tree cleanup before Pi exits.
- It does not survive a crash, a kill without SIGTERM, or a machine reboot. Those skip `session_shutdown`, so no quit entry exists. A reload entry is never treated as quit work.
- `/until-resume` is the manual path when automatic recovery did not apply, for example after a crash that left only a reload entry. It reads the newest suspension entry with the same skips and marks it consumed.
- Print and JSON modes reject new watches because those processes are not durable owners. A print or JSON run of a session neither restores its watches nor writes a quit entry, so it cannot bury a pending one.
- Entries written by `0.5.0` carry no reason. A `0.5.0` quit entry is restored only when it is newer than the session header and no conversation message follows it.

This boundary is intentional. `pi-until` is a session primitive, not another scheduler or daemon.

## Telemetry

The extension appends one JSON line per event to `~/.pi/agent/pi-until/events.jsonl`. Nothing leaves the machine. Events: `started`, `finished`, `suspended`, `resumed`, and `action` (tool or command use). A condition is recorded only as a 12-character hash; no command fragment is written. Recurring instructions, quick references, and context pointers are never written to telemetry. Labels are written, so keep them safe.

- `PI_UNTIL_TELEMETRY=0` disables it.
- `PI_UNTIL_TELEMETRY_FILE=/path/events.jsonl` moves it.
- `/until-stats` prints counts by status and wake mode, median attempts and duration, and reload suspend/resume counts.
- `/until-resume` resumes watches from the newest suspension entry when automatic restart recovery did not apply.

## Safety

Conditions run through the inherited shell with the same permissions as Pi. The extension discards stdout and stderr. Cancellation and timeouts terminate the condition's process group on macOS and Linux.

Use side-effect-free, idempotent checks. A condition string is arbitrary shell access; installing this extension grants that capability even when Pi's normal bash tool is disabled. Do not put secrets in commands, labels, task snapshots, or context pointers. Recurring task packets remain in the private Pi session, but they are still persisted session data. If the thing needs a durable cross-process owner, use the real workload scheduler instead.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run pack:dry
```

One XState v5 machine owns each watch:

```text
active.routing -> waiting -> checking -----------------> satisfied
       |            |          |                            (shell)
       |            |          +-> duePending
       |            +------------> duePending -> awaitingSettlement
       |                                      -> routing  (recurring)
       +-> completed | expired | cancelled | failed
```

A second XState v5 machine owns the session delivery queue:

```text
ready -> queued -> awaiting message_start -> awaiting agent_settled -> ready
```

`src/command.ts` parses the flat provider schema once into an internal command. The watch machine owns cadence, expiry, checks, delivery counts, missed ticks, and terminal state. The session queue owns cross-watch serialization, message correlation, deduplication, dispatch acknowledgement, and the compaction hold. The extension only adapts these parts to Pi lifecycle events, receipts, and UI.
